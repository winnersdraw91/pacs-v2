- **Study ID Generation**: Automatic 8-digit alphanumeric IDs (X3LUIDBH, SDHL91E6)
- **Progress Feedback**: Upload success messages displayed

### DICOM Viewer ✅
- **Study Loading**: Successfully loaded DICOM study from storage
- **Image Display**: Proper rendering of DICOM pixel data with windowing
- **Navigation**: Instance navigation working (1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3)
- **Metadata Display**: Patient name, age, gender, study description shown
- **Viewer Controls**: Clean, professional medical imaging interface

### Role-Based Dashboards ✅
- **Technician Dashboard**: Statistics, recent uploads, quick actions
- **Layout**: Consistent navigation with role-specific menu items
- **UI/UX**: Professional medical application design

## Database Initialization ✅
- **Schema Creation**: All tables created successfully
- **Default Users**: Admin, radiologist, technician created
- **Demo Centre**: Diagnostic centre with pricing configs initialized
- **Pricing Setup**: CT, X-ray, MRI pricing configured in USD

## DICOM Storage ✅
- **File Organization**: Structured storage at `/storage/{centre_name}/{study_id}/`
- **File Retrieval**: DICOM files accessible for viewing
- **Metadata Extraction**: Patient info and study details extracted from DICOM headers
- **Multi-Instance Support**: Multiple DICOM instances per study handled correctly

## Known Issues

### AI Module Dependencies ⚠️
- **Status**: AI modules implemented but currently disabled
- **Reason**: Poetry dependency resolution error ("Could not parse version constraint: <empty>")
- **Impact**: System works fully without AI, gracefully falls back
- **Workaround**: Manual pip installation in poetry environment may resolve
- **Affected Features**: 
  - AI-based report generation (MiniGPT-Med)
  - Automated image analysis (MONAI, TorchIO)
  - Pathology detection
- **API Behavior**: AI endpoints return 503 error with clear message when AI unavailable

## Test Data Used

### DICOM Studies
1. **Study X3LUIDBH**: 3 instances, CT Scan - Chest, created for system validation
2. **Study SDHL91E6**: 3 instances, CT Scan - Chest, created for viewer validation

### Reports
1. **Report ID 1**: Preliminary chest CT report with findings and impression, verified by radiologist

### Billing
1. **Invoice INV14191298**: $150 USD billing for study 1 (CT scan)

## Security Testing ✅
- **JWT Authentication**: Working correctly for all endpoints
- **Role-Based Access**: Proper authorization checks in place
- **Protected Routes**: Frontend routes protected by auth
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords stored securely (bcrypt)

## Performance Notes
- **Backend Response Time**: Fast API responses (< 500ms for all tested endpoints)
- **DICOM Upload**: Quick upload and processing for test files
- **Viewer Load Time**: DICOM images render promptly in browser
- **Database Queries**: Efficient query performance with SQLAlchemy

## Next Steps for Production

### Recommended Before Deployment
1. Resolve AI dependency installation issues for full AI functionality
2. Add comprehensive test suite (unit and integration tests)
3. Configure production environment variables
4. Set up proper logging and monitoring
5. Review and enhance security configurations

### Deployment Readiness
- ✅ Docker and Docker Compose configurations ready
- ✅ Environment variable templates provided (.env.example)
- ✅ Database migrations configured (Alembic)
- ✅ CORS settings configurable for production
- ✅ Backend deployable to Fly.io (FastAPI + Poetry)
- ✅ Frontend deployable (built static files)

## Conclusion
The core PACS system is **fully functional** with all major features working correctly:
- Multi-role authentication and authorization
- DICOM upload, storage, and viewing
- Report creation and verification workflows
- Billing and pricing management
- User and centre management
- Professional medical imaging interface

The only limitation is the optional AI features which are gracefully disabled due to dependency issues but don't impact core functionality.
